    		<h2>Multi-Modal Imaging of the Aging Brain</h2>
		Broadly, I am interested in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)<br>
		to understand brain changes that are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
		<br>
		My first taste of science was in the Jagust Lab at UC Berkeley. There, I worked on projects that used fMRI and amyloid-PET<br>
		to investigate the relationship between healthy brain network connectivity and the distribution of amyloid plaques<br>
		in aging and in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.<br>
		<br>
		Nowadays, I do research in the Brewer Lab at UCSD. My current project is using using longitudinal MRI, amyloid-PET,<br>
		and tau-PET to assess the relationships between amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration in the earliest stages of<br>
		Alzheimer's disease.
		<br>


		<h2>Open-Source Software</h2>
		My weapon of choice for my work is Python and I am a frequent user of modules such as NumPy, SciPy,<br>
		and NiBabel. My research has benefited greatly from freely available, open-source software so I think it's only<br>
		right that I make an effort to contribute to a community that has given me so much. For this reason, I am <br>
		making a conscious effort to post my code <a href="https://github.com/leonardinosaur">online</a> in case bits and pieces of it are helpful to others.<br> 
		<br>
		My first full-scale project will be <a href="pet2mri.readthedocs.io">pet2mri</a>,a set of tools for processing, quantifying, and organizing<br>
		PET data. The scripts will essentially be wrappers for various FreeSurfer. It's not available though pip yet,<br>
		but is still available for download. Please see the <a href="pet2mri.readthedocs.io">documentation</a> for more information.<br>
