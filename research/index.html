    		<h2>Multi-Modal Imaging of the Aging Brain</h2>
		Broadly, I am interested in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)
		to understand brain changes that are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders.
		<br><br>
		My first taste of science was in the Jagust Lab at UC Berkeley. There, I worked on projects that used fMRI and amyloid-PET
		to investigate the relationship between healthy brain network connectivity and the distribution of amyloid plaques
		in aging and in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
		<br><br>
		Nowadays, I do research in the Brewer Lab at UCSD. My current project is using using longitudinal MRI, amyloid-PET,
		and tau-PET to assess the relationships between amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration in the earliest stages of
		Alzheimer's disease.
		<br>


		<h2>Open-Source Software</h2>
		My weapon of choice for my work is Python and I am a frequent user of modules such as NumPy, SciPy,
		and NiBabel. My research has benefited greatly from freely available, open-source software so I think it's only
		right that I make an effort to contribute to a community that has given me so much. I am
		making a conscious effort to post my code <a href="https://github.com/leonardinosaur">online</a> in case bits and pieces of it are helpful to others. 
		<br><br>
		My first full-scale project will be <a href="http://pet2mri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pet2mri</a>, a set of tools for processing, quantifying, and organizing
		PET data. It will essentially be a set of scripts that are wrappers for various FreeSurfer commands. It's not available on pip yet,
		but a bare-bones version can be downloaded. Please see the <a href="http://pet2mri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> for more information.
