    		<h2>Multi-Modal Imaging of the Aging Brain</h2>
		Broadly, I am interested in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)
		to understand brain changes that are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders.
		<br><br>
		My first taste of science was in the Jagust Lab at UC Berkeley. There, I worked on projects that used fMRI and amyloid-PET
		to investigate the relationship between healthy brain network connectivity and the distribution of amyloid plaques
		in aging and in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
		<br><br>
		Nowadays, I do research in the Brewer Lab at UCSD. My current project is using using longitudinal MRI, amyloid-PET,
		and tau-PET to assess the relationships between amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration in the earliest stages of
		Alzheimer's disease.
		<br>


		<h2>Open-Source Software</h2>
		My weapon of choice for my work is Python and I am a frequent user of modules such as NumPy, SciPy,
		and NiBabel. My research has benefited greatly from freely available, open-source software so I think it's only
		right that I make an effort to contribute to a community that has given me so much. For this reason, I am
		making a conscious effort to post my code <a href="https://github.com/leonardinosaur">online</a> in case bits and pieces of it are helpful to others. 
		<br><br>
		My first full-scale project will be <a href="http://pet2mri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pet2mri</a>,a set of tools for processing, quantifying, and organizing
		PET data. The scripts will essentially be wrappers for various FreeSurfer commands. It's not available though pip yet,
		but cant still be downloaded. Please see the <a href="http://pet2mri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> for more information.
