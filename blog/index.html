			<h2>What is Alzheimer's disease?</h2>
			<b>2 Feb 2018</b>
			<br><br>
			One of my family’s favorite pastimes is watching <i>Jeopardy</i>, an evening game show that airs nightly on NBC. A battle of the wits of sorts, the game proceeds as follows. First, a contest picks a clue from a certain category worth a specified dollar amount. The host, Alex Trebek, then reads the clue and whichever of the three contestant buzzes in first gets the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant answers correctly, they receive the sum of money attached to that particular clue and selects the next. The rules are relatively straightforward, but there is one quirk: The clues are given in the form of <i>answers</i>, and the responses provided by the contestants must be formulated as <i>questions</i>.
 			<br><br>
			For example, if I were a contestant on Jeopardy and it was my turn to select a clue, I might say “Let’s do ‘Colors’ (the category) for $200 (specified dollar amount) please, Alex”. If the clue were to be “This is the color of the sky”. I would buzz in, correctly answer “What is blue?”, and $200 would be added to my going total. Simple enough.
			<br><br>
			Below, I have listed three statements. In the rare case that they were to ever show up as clues on Jeopardy verbatim, all three could correctly be answered with either of the following:
			<br><br><i>
				What is Alzheimer’s disease?<br>
				What is aging?<br></i>
			<br><br>
			Through this exercise, I hope to illustrate why understanding and, by extension, finding a cure for Alzheimer’s disease has proven to be a particular difficult problem for neuroscientists. Let’s get this party started - <i>Science for $200 please Alex</i>.
			<br><br>
			<i>Alex: Shrinkage of the hippocampus occurs during…
			<br><br>
			Scenario 1 - Dino: What is Alzheimer’s disease? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			The hippocampus is a brain structure located adjacent to the temples on either side of the head. The term itself is of Greek origin, where <i>hippo</i> translates to horse and <i>kampos</i> roughly to sea monster. The hippocampus is named so due to its being shaped like a seahorse. Several studies have suggested that this region is important for making new memories. You might remember a case study from Psych 101 of Henry Molaison (or Patient HM), who had both hippocampi removed and was unable (to some extent) make new memories.
			<br><br>
			The hippocampus undergoes selective shrinkage or (in neuroscience lexicon) atrophy during Alzheimer’s disease. This seems to make sense given that one of the many clinical symptoms that presents with Alzheimer’s disease is memory impairment. Estimates of how much the hippocampus shrinks in Alzheimer’s disease usually hover around 5 percent per year.
			<br><br><i>
			Scenario 2 - Dino: What is aging? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			There are several discernable brain changes that occur with normal aging. Interestingly, one of them is shrinkage of the hippocampus, which has now been shown in several studies that have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to analyze the brains of older adults. These changes are often of smaller magnitude than those found in Alzheimer’s disease, but still quite substantial.

			Dino: Let’s do Science fo $800 Alex<br>
			Alex: Amyloid plaques in the brain occur during...
			<br><br>
			Scenario 1 - Dino: What is Alzheimer’s disease? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			When Alois Alzheimer first described the disease that would later bare his name, he was investigating the brain of one his deceased patients through a microscope. He noted two major abnormalities. The first was a blob that turned out to be a plaque of a protein called amyloid-beta. These plaques were scattered all throughout the brain.
			<br><br>
			The amyloid-beta plaques are now a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease. To put it another way, if you do not have the amyloid plaques in your brain, you technically cannot be deemed as having Alzheimer’s disease.
			<br><br><i>
			Scenario 2 - Dino: What is normal aging? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			Strikingly, there is a large proportion of healthy older individuals (estimates range from 20-40%) that have amyloid plaques in their brain. These individuals are cognitively intact such that they function at the same level as their counterparts that do not have plaques. This was revealed by several <i>post mortem</i> studies of cognitively healthy older folks. That is, studies where participants’ brains were examined under a microscope after they died.
			<br><br>
			The presence of amyloid plaques in healthy people means, of course, that while amyloid plaques are necessary to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, having amyloid plaques in your brain does not imply that you have Alzheimer’s disease.
			<br><br><i>
			Dino: Let’s finish it off with $1000 in Science<br>
			Alex: Tau pathology in the brain occurs during…
			<br><br>
			Scenario 1 - Dino: What is Alzheimer’s disease? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			The other major abnormality that Alois Alzheimer found was the neurofibrillary tangle composed of a protein called tau. Tau is a protein produced inside healthy cells, where they are thought to play an important role in the structural integrity of the cell - think scaffolding. At some point, they are thought to transition from being helpers in the cell to being toxic to the brain, but this process is not fully understood.
			<br><br><i>
			Scenario 2 - Dino: What is normal aging? *Ding ding ding*</i><br>
			There is an seminal scientific article written by pathologists Heiko and Eva Braak that first described the different stages of tau tangle pathology. An important finding in their experiment was that, like amyloid, tau tangles were also present in completely cognitively healthy individuals.
			<br><br><i>
			Thanks for playing. </i>
			<br><br>
			I hope that you now feel well equipped to tackle Jeopardy tomorrow night at 730pm on NBC (not an ad) but, more importantly, I hope that the following take home point is clear:
			<br><br><i>
			Many of the consequences of Alzheimer’s disease are also consequences of normal aging
			<br><br></i>
			This phenomenon continues to be one of the major challenges we researchers are faced with in trying to understand the disease. We are cursed by <i>colinearity</i>. Whereby many
			of the things we think drive the disease can also be explained simply by aging.
			<br><br>
			Thanks for reading my first post. I’ll try to write something every two weeks or so.
			<br><br>
